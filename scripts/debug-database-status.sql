-- Debug script to check the current status of the tweaks database
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to diagnose issues

-- 1. Check if tweaks table exists
SELECT
  'tweaks table' as check_name,
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tweaks')
    THEN '‚úÖ EXISTS'
    ELSE '‚ùå MISSING - Run scripts/010-create-tweaks-table.sql'

-- 2. Check if tweak_reports table exists
SELECT
  'tweak_reports table' as check_name,
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tweak_reports')
    THEN '‚úÖ EXISTS'
    ELSE '‚ùå MISSING - Run scripts/010-create-tweaks-table.sql'

-- 3. Check if RPC functions exist
SELECT

  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name = 'get_featured_tweaks')
    THEN '‚úÖ EXISTS'

-- 4. Count tweaks in database (only if table exists)
DO $$

    RAISE NOTICE 'üìä TWEAKS COUNT:';
    PERFORM 1; -- Placeholder, the actual counts will be shown below

-- Show tweaks count if table exists
SELECT
  'Total tweaks' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tweaks
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tweaks');

SELECT
  'Active tweaks' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tweaks
WHERE is_active = true
AND EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tweaks');

SELECT
  'Featured tweaks' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tweaks
WHERE is_featured = true AND is_active = true
AND EXISTS (SELECT FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tweaks');

-- 5. Show sample of tweaks data if any exists
SELECT
  'üìã SAMPLE TWEAKS:' as info,
  '' as title,
  '' as category,
  '' as status
WHERE FALSE -- This is just a header

UNION ALL

SELECT
